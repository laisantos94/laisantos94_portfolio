# üñ•Ô∏è Development
---
Along my first IT work experience as a Technical Writer, I had the privilege to develop product documentation through Docs as Code approach.

That's how I started to connect myself with some Web Development activities and tools, such as Version Control, when I learned about Git and Azure DevOps, HTML5 and CSS3.

As I developed docs with VitePress, I decided to apply everything I've learned so far to build this portfolio and explore my skills as a potential Entry-Level Developer.

So, here's what I did by building that simple portfolio:

- Dependencies install process (Yarn) and VitePress version.
- Structuring of all repositories on the development environment.
- Defining of routing of the pages.
- Customization of the preset VitePress theme to my own theme by applying CSS3 on Markdown elements.
- Deploying process through Netlify.

I keep doing my best to make progress and bring better Web Development projects soon.
