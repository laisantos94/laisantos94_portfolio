## Overview
Redesign proposal for the Casadorada store website designed that was delievered as a challenge for a UX/UI Design job apply.

## My Role
- UI Design
- Prototyping

### Tools
- Figma

## The Problem
At the time, the store was being affected by a drop in their sales, and it was necessary to take an action to change this scenario.

## The Challenge
As I didn't have enough time or access to more information to explore the problem, I made an analysis of the current UI Design to think about what could be improved to the user experience, considering the visual aspect of the website.

I was requested to redesign the **Homepage** and the **Mini Cart** of the website.

In my review, I noticed that some usability heuristics hadn't been applied to the pages. So I tried to think in that direction.

## Redesigned Points
### Homepage
- Removing of the four items next to the Search Bar to contained in this section, in order to reduce the cognitive load for the user.
- In the navigation items, I added an pointed down outlined chevron, to indicate the more options that are displayed while hovering.
- Adding of more contrast to the arrows on the carousel banner, so the user can easily view and move to the previous or next slide.
- Rearranging of sections, positioning the "Novidades" section right after the carousel to motivate the user to check what's new in the store.
- Repositioning of the information about price of the product and the button "Adicionar ao carrinho" to bring a better visual hierarchy to the interface.
- Changing colors of the discount banner to provide more constrast and a better arrangement to the Input elements.
- On the "About the Store" section, I divided it in two columns in order to include more contrast, to provide better distribution of the text and improve the reading experience.

### Mini Cart
- Displaying of the purchase steps to the user, in order to attend the "Visibility of system status" heuristic.
