## Overview
Reference service is an activity carried out by librarians in information environments, which consists in supporting users in their information needs, in order to promote access, dissemination and use of information.

As a part of academic routine, users usually go to the library for:

- Reading.
- Internet access.
- Group meetings.
- Bibliographic materials consult.
- Loan and return of materials.

## Research
A survey was applied to the library users to understand what they do when they need to access and use bibliographic information.

- 45% of the users said that, when they can't find a book, they look for it in another library.
- Only 18% of them ask librarians for help to get what they need.

Analyzing the data obtained in the interview with the librarian, the team discovered that:

- The library didn't have a channel for take suggestions, complaints or compliments from the users.

So, we thought and designed a solution for that issue.

## The Product

Our product is a channel designed to facilitate communication between library users and the library management, allowing users to signal their demands and provide feedback about their experience using the library products and services.
