# Who I am
Hello and welcome!

I am Lais, someone who believes that willing people can always make this world better.

Motivated by the curiosity to learn and explore new things, I see challenges as an opportunity to grow and go further. Regarding the behavioral perspective, I cherish active listening and open communication to always make things clear.

My work dynamics is oriented by strategic perspectives, such as dedication, self-management, organization, proactivity, collaboration, open communication and attention to detail. That's how I help people and businesses to achieve what they need.

I've always seen technology as an instrument for connecting people and their needs.

During my academic time, I worked as a researcher, developing studies about Interaction Design in the Information Science context. After graduation, I studied about Product Design, in order to achieve a career transition, which didn't happen at the time.

In the half of 2022, I was accepted for a job as a Technical Writer, my first work experience in the IT field, which gave me the opportunity to develop Documentation skills.

For me, every opportunity to learn is meaningful for the human development, and I am sure that all these experiences helped me to become a multidisciplinary professional.

At this moment, my main professional goals are:
- Being known and recognized for the quality of my work.
- Building a career capable of taking me anywhere in the world. 
- Helping others through my knowledge and experience.

As I've had experience working in mutiple fields so far, I believe this gathering of skills makes me a very authentic IT professional, making me someone strongly able to provide great contributions to any team I will be part of.
